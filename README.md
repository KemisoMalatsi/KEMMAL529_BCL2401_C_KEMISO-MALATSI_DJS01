# MARS CLIMATE ORBITER

This project implements a robust calculation system that ensures accurate calculations and handles potential errors gracefully. It addresses issues such as unit mismatches, parameter validity, and calculation errors.

## Solution Approach

- **Object Destructuring**: Function parameters are structured using object destructuring for better clarity and readability.
- **Accurate Unit Conversions**: Unit conversions are implemented within the functions to ensure consistency in units throughout the calculations.
- **Error Handling**: Potential errors, such as invalid parameters or calculation errors, are handled gracefully using error messages.

## Expected Corrected Results

- **New Velocity**: Approximately 48880 km/h after correction.
- **New Distance**: Approximately 10000 km after correction.
- **Remaining Fuel**: Approximately 3200 kg after correction.
